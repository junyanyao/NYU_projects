    "For many years there has been controversy regarding whether maternal employment has a detrimental or beneficial effect on children across a variety of dimensions.  The policy implications of such links range from considerations regarding when mothers participating in TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) should be forced to return to work after giving birth, to proposed changes in provisions under the Family and Medical Leave Act regarding length of leave and who is covered.  We will use data on a sample of women and children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (data, codebook and description of survey in separate files on Blackboard in this section) to explore whether or not there appears to be a causal link between maternal employment and children’s cognitive development."

Decide what variables should be considered confounding covariates in the subsequent analyses.  Then prioritize the confounders into three categories (most important to balance, somewhat less important to balance, least important to balance) with roughly the same number of variables in each category. When assessing model fit I'd like to evaluate balance on all of these variables, regardless of whether all of them end up in final propensity score model.

I think both birthweight and weeks of pre-term are related with child’s health. I think mom’s race and education, mom’s age, and if the child is first born or not, are also associated with the treatment and the outcome. But I think these factors could be less related to the treatment than family income and child’s health status. Other factors such as child’s age, mom’s score on the armed forces qualifying test, respondent’s mom employment status in high school, and if the child is female or not, are the least important confounding covariates. Even though I think they are associated with treatment and outcome, but I think they probably won’t affect the outcome significantly. "
